# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
The most difficult part for me while completing the match function was understanding
what the test cases were looking for for #2. When I was trying to complete #2 on 
my own, I was having trouble identifying what was changing between the test cases
and what the patterns were for getting it right. Trying to do things the pythonic way
instead of the java way was also difficult. 


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
The match funciton could be used for extracting information from a movie database
